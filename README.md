Hand Detection: The game uses a webcam to capture live video. Python, along with the OpenCV library, is used to process this video feed. The software detects the player's hand using hand detection algorithms. These algorithms can identify the hand's position, movements, and possibly gestures.
Letter Display: On the screen, there's a display of letters in a random or structured arrangement. These letters could be shown in grids, rows, or any other creative format.
Letter Selection: The player can move their hand in the view of the camera to interact with the game. The motion of the hand is tracked in real-time. When the player's hand hovers over or gestures towards a specific letter, the game detects this action.
Game Objective: The objective of the game is to select letters in ascending order (A to Z). The player uses hand movements to 'choose' each letter in sequence. The game could provide visual feedback (like highlighting the letter) or auditory feedback (like a sound) to confirm the selection.
